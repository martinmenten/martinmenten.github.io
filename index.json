Subsequently, I earned my PhD from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, where I developed automated strategies to adapt external beam radiotherapy for cancer to anatomical changes. After completing my doctoral studies in 2019, I transitioned into computer science by joining the Biomedical Image Analysis group at Imperial College London. In 2021, I moved to the Technical University of Munich, where I established my own research group in 2024.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"598b63dd58b43bce02403646f240cd3c","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"author","summary":"I am an independent research group leader at the Technical University Munich.
