This study systematically investigates the impact of geometric imaging parameters on the ability of 2D cine MR imaging to guide template-matching-driven autocontouring of lung tumors and abdominal organs.Abdominal 4D MR images were acquired of six healthy volunteers and thoracic 4D MR images were obtained of eight lung cancer patients. At each breathing phase of the images, the left kidney and gallbladder or lung tumor, respectively, were outlined as volumes of interest. These images and contours were used to create artificial 2D cine MR images, while simultaneously serving as 3D ground truth. We explored the impact of five different imaging parameters (pixel size, slice thickness, imaging plane orientation, number and relative alignment of images as well as strategies to create training images). For each possible combination of imaging parameters, we generated artificial 2D cine MR images as training and test images. A template-matching algorithm used the training images to determine the tumor or organ position in the test images. Subsequently, a 3D base contour was shifted to the determined position and compared to the ground truth via centroid distance and Dice similarity coefficient.The median centroid distance between adapted and ground truth contours was 1.56 mm for the kidney, 3.81 mm for the gallbladder and 1.03 mm for the lung tumor (median Dice similarity coefficient: 0.95, 0.72 and 0.93). We observed that a decrease in image resolution led to a modest decrease in localization accuracy, especially for the small gallbladder. However, for all volumes of interest localization accuracy varied substantially more between subjects than due to the different imaging parameters.Automated tumor and organ localization using 2D cine MR imaging and template-matching-based autocontouring is robust against variation of geometric imaging parameters. Future work and optimization efforts of 2D cine MR imaging for real-time adaptive radiotherapy is needed to characterize the influence of sequence- and anatomical site-specific imaging contrast.","tags":[],"title":"The impact of 2D cine MR imaging parameters on automated tumor and organ localization for MR-guided real-time adaptive radiotherapy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["MJ Menten","A Wetscherek","MF Fast"],"categories":null,"content":"\u0026nbsp;\n","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"ce2aeaac7c658be9a934e605403f2c3a","permalink":"/publication/lungsbrtreview/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lungsbrtreview/","section":"publication","summary":"Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is rapidly becoming an alternative to surgery for the treatment of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer patients. Lung SBRT is administered in a hypo-fractionated, conformal manner, delivering high doses to the target. To avoid normal-tissue toxicity, it is crucial to limit the exposure of nearby healthy organs-at-risk (OAR).Current image-guided radiotherapy strategies for lung SBRT are mostly based on X-ray imaging modalities. Although still in its infancy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance for lung SBRT is not exposure-limited and MRI promises to improve crucial soft-tissue contrast. Looking beyond anatomical imaging, functional MRI is expected to inform treatment decisions and adaptations in the future.This review summarises and discusses how MRI could be advantageous to the different links of the radiotherapy treatment chain for lung SBRT: diagnosis and staging, tumour and OAR delineation, treatment planning, and inter- or intrafractional motion management. Special emphasis is placed on a new generation of hybrid MRI treatment devices and their potential for real-time adaptive radiotherapy.","tags":[],"title":"MRI-guided lung SBRT: Present and future developments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["MF Fast","B Eiben","MJ Menten","A Wetscherek","DJ Hawkes"," JR McClelland","U Oelfke"],"categories":null,"content":"\u0026nbsp;\n","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"518dfe9575923e95ac9cc97d3fef3caa","permalink":"/publication/4alg/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/4alg/","section":"publication","summary":"**Background and purpose:** Radiotherapy guidance based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently becoming a clinical reality. Fast 2d cine MRI sequences are expected to increase the precision of radiation delivery by facilitating tumour delineation during treatment. This study compares four auto-contouring algorithms for the task of delineating the primary tumour in six locally advanced (LA) lung cancer patients. **Material and methods:** Twenty-two cine MRI sequences were acquired using either a balanced steady-state free precession or a spoiled gradient echo imaging technique. Contours derived by the auto-contouring algorithms were compared against manual reference contours. A selection of eight image data sets was also used to assess the inter-observer delineation uncertainty. **Results:** Algorithmically derived contours agreed well with the manual reference contours (median Dice similarity index: ). Multi-template matching and deformable image registration performed significantly better than feature-driven registration and the pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN). Neither MRI sequence nor image orientation was a conclusive predictor for algorithmic performance. Motion significantly degraded the performance of the PCNN. The inter-observer variability was of the same order of magnitude as the algorithmic performance. **Conclusions:** Auto-contouring of tumours on cine MRI is feasible in LA lung cancer patients. Despite large variations in implementation complexity, the different algorithms all have relatively similar performance.","tags":[],"title":"Tumour auto-contouring on 2d cine MRI for locally advanced lung cancer: A comparative study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["HE Bainbridge","MJ Menten","MF Fast","S Nill","U Oelfke","F McDonald"],"categories":null,"content":"\u0026nbsp;\n","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509494400,"objectID":"096590812b932b0bfb558245b4a2a7ae","permalink":"/publication/ereps2/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ereps2/","section":"publication","summary":"**Purpose:** This study investigates the feasibility and potential benefits of radiotherapy with a 1.5 T MR-Linac for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA NSCLC) patients. **Material and methods:** Ten patients with LA NSCLC were retrospectively re-planned six times: three treatment plans were created according to a protocol for conventionally fractionated radiotherapy and three treatment plans following guidelines for isotoxic target dose escalation. In each case, two plans were designed for the MR-Linac, either with standard (~7 mm) or reduced (~3 mm) planning target volume (PTV) margins, while one conventional linac plan was created with standard margins. Treatment plan quality was evaluated using dose–volume metrics or by quantifying dose escalation potential. **Results:** All generated treatment plans fulfilled their respective planning constraints. For conventionally fractionated treatments, MR-Linac plans with standard margins had slightly increased skin dose when compared to conventional linac plans. Using reduced margins alleviated this issue and decreased exposure of several other organs-at-risk (OAR). Reduced margins also enabled increased isotoxic target dose escalation. **Conclusions:** It is feasible to generate treatment plans for LA NSCLC patients on a 1.5 T MR-Linac. Margin reduction, facilitated by an envisioned MRI-guided workflow, enables increased OAR sparing and isotoxic target dose escalation for the respective treatment approaches.","tags":[],"title":"Treating locally advanced lung cancer with a 1.5 T MR-Linac – Effects of the magnetic field and irradiation geometry on conventionally fractionated and isotoxic dose-escalated radiotherapy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["MJ Menten","MF Fast","S Nill","CP Kamerling","F McDonald","U Oelfke"],"categories":null,"content":"\u0026nbsp;\n","date":1464735600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464735600,"objectID":"41c890dbe8fcb89e5aab19d279ac0eaa","permalink":"/publication/ereps1/","publishdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ereps1/","section":"publication","summary":"**Background and purpose:** There are concerns that radiotherapy doses delivered in a magnetic field might be distorted due to the Lorentz force deflecting secondary electrons. This study investigates this effect on lung stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) treatments, conducted either with or without multileaf collimator (MLC) tumor tracking. **Material and methods:** Lung SBRT treatments with an MR-linac were simulated for nine patients. Two different treatment techniques were compared: conventional, non-tracked deliveries and deliveries with real-time MLC tumor tracking, each conducted either with or without a 1.5 T magnetic field. **Results:** Slight dose distortions at air-tissue-interfaces were observed in the presence of the magnetic field. Most prominently, the dose to 2% of the skin increased by 1.4 Gy on average. Regardless of the presence of the magnetic field, MLC tracking was able to spare healthy tissue, for example by decreasing the mean lung dose by 0.3 Gy on average, while maintaining the target dose. **Conclusions:** Accounting for the magnetic field during treatment plan optimization allowed for design and delivery of clinically acceptable lung SBRT treatments with an MR-linac.

This study investigates the use of dual-energy imaging, which can generate radiographs with reduced bone visibility, to enhance automated lung tumor tracking for real-time adaptive radiotherapy.**Methods:** LkV images of an anthropomorphic breathing chest phantom were experimentally acquired and radiographs of actual lung cancer patients were Monte-Carlo-simulated at three imaging settings: low-energy (70 kVp, 1.5 mAs), high-energy (140 kVp, 2.5 mAs, 1 mm additional tin filtration), and clinical (120 kVp, 0.25 mAs). Regular dual-energy images were calculated by weighted logarithmic subtraction of high- and low-energy images and filter-free dual-energy images were generated from clinical and low-energy radiographs. The weighting factor to calculate the dual-energy images was determined by means of a novel objective score. The usefulness of dual-energy imaging for real-time tracking with an automated template matching algorithm was investigated.**Results:** Regular dual-energy imaging was able to increase tracking accuracy in left–right images of the anthropomorphic phantom as well as in 7 out of 24 investigated patient cases. Tracking accuracy remained comparable in three cases and decreased in five cases. Filter-free dual-energy imaging was only able to increase accuracy in 2 out of 24 cases. In four cases no change in accuracy was observed and tracking accuracy worsened in nine cases. In 9 out of 24 cases, it was not possible to define a tracking template due to poor soft-tissue contrast regardless of input images. The mean localization errors using clinical, regular dual-energy, and filter-free dual-energy radiographs were 3.85, 3.32, and 5.24 mm, respectively. Tracking success was dependent on tumor position, tumor size, imaging beam angle, and patient size. **Conclusions:** This study has highlighted the influence of patient anatomy on the success rate of real-time markerless tumor tracking using dual-energy imaging. Additionally, the importance of the spectral separation of the imaging beams used to generate the dual-energy images has been shown.","tags":[],"title":"Using dual-energy x‐ray imaging to enhance automated lung tumor tracking during real-time adaptive radiotherapy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["MJ Menten","M Guckenberger","C Herrmann","A Krauß","S Nill","U Oelfke","J Wilbert"],"categories":null,"content":"\u0026nbsp;\n","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351728000,"objectID":"acd2b37f871f00b31b9db0e97d16559b","permalink":"/publication/couchvsmlc/","publishdate":"2012-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/couchvsmlc/","section":"publication","summary":"**Purpose:** One limitation of accurate dose delivery in radiotherapy is intrafractional movement of the tumor or the entire patient which may lead to an underdosage of the target tissue or an overdosage of adjacent organs at risk. In order to compensate for this movement, different techniques have been developed. In this study the tracking performances of a multileaf collimator (MLC) tracking system and a robotic treatment couch tracking system were compared under equal conditions. **Methods:** MLC tracking was performed using a tracking system based on the Siemens 160 MLC. A HexaPOD robotic treatment couch tracking system was also installed at the same linac. A programmable 4D motion stage was used to reproduce motion trajectories with different target phantoms. Motion localization of the target was provided by the 4D tracking system of Calypso Medical Inc. The gained positional data served as input signal for the control systems of the MLC and HexaPOD tracking systems attempting to compensate for the target motion. The geometric and dosimetric accuracy for the tracking of eight different respiratory motion trajectories was investigated for both systems. The dosimetric accuracy of both systems was also evaluated for the tracking of five prostate motion trajectories. **Results:** For the respiratory motion the average root mean square error of all trajectories iny direction was reduced from 4.1 to 2.0 mm for MLC tracking and to 2.2 mm for HexaPOD tracking. In x direction it was reduced from 1.9 to 0.9 mm (MLC) and to 1.0 mm (HexaPOD). The average 2%/2 mm gamma pass rate for the respiratory motion trajectories was increased from 76.4% for no tracking to 89.8% and 95.3% for the MLC and the HexaPOD tracking systems, respectively. For the prostate motion trajectories the average 2%/2 mm gamma pass rate was 60.1% when no tracking was applied and was improved to 85.0% for MLC tracking and 95.3% for the HexaPOD tracking system.  **Conclusions:** Both systems clearly increased the geometric and dosimetric accuracy during tracking of respiratory motion trajectories. Thereby, the geometric accuracy was increased almost equally by both systems, whereas the dosimetric accuracy of the HexaPOD tracking system was slightly better for all considered respiratory motion trajectories. Substantial improvement of the dosimetric accuracy was also observed during tracking of prostate motion trajectories during an intensity‐modulated radiotherapy plan. Thereby, the HexaPOD tracking system showed better results than the MLC tracking.","tags":[],"title":"Comparison of a multileaf collimator tracking system and a robotic treatment couch tracking system for organ motion compensation during radiotherapy","type":"publication"}]
