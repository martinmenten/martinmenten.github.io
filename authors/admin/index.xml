      <description>I am a postdoc researching real-time adaptive radiotherapy in the group of Professor Uwe Oelfke at the Institute of Cancer Research in London.
I recently obtained my PhD in medical physics from the ICR. Before that, I studied physics at Heidelberg University, Germany, while completing research projects at the German Cancer Research Center and University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA.
Radiotherapy treats cancer by targeted exposure of tumors to ionizing radiation. Its effect is often diminished by changes in the patient&amp;rsquo;s anatomy during dose delivery as these may lead to underdosage of the tumor and unwanted irradiation of nearby organs.</description>
