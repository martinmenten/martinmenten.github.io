      <description>I recently joined the BioMedIA group at Imperial College London as a postdoctoral researcher. Working together with Professor Daniel Rueckert, I am exploring the use of deep learning to advance the understanding and diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly.
Previously, I received my PhD in physics from the Institute of Cancer Research in 2018. In the team of Professor Uwe Oelfke, I researched strategies to adapt external beam radiotherapy to anatomical changes in real-time in order to increase cure rates and reduce side effects of cancer treatments.</description>
