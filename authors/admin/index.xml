      <description>I am an independent research group leader at the Technical University Munich. My group is funded by the Emmy Noether Programme of the German Research Foundation and is hosted at the Institute for AI in Healthcare and Medicine. I also have a secondary affiliation with Imperial College London.
My research focuses development and application of machine learning algorithms for the fields of medical imaging and ophthalmology. I am particularly interested in weakly and self-supervised learning to address data scarcity in healthcare and the integration of multimodal clinical data with medical images.</description>
